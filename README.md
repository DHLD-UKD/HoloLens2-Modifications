# HoloLens 2 Modifications
This repo provides 3D-printable models that can be attached to the HoloLens 2.

## Motivation
The viewing direction of the integrated webcam of the HoloLens 2 is aligned with the view of a user in a face-to-face scenario with an area of interest directly in front of the user. For applications in which the area of interest is not located directly in front of the user this might be insufficient. For instance, scenarios like surgery, where the surgeon wants to stream the surgery with the HoloLens 2, but also wants to maintain an upright ergonomic posture to prevent neck or back pain.
Therefore, two different approches where tested to change the viewing direction of the integrated webcam, since tilting of the camera is not possible.

- Mirror
- Prism

This mount could also be customized to attach additional optical components to the HoloLens like, Filters (Polarisation, ND, ..) or magnification lenses.
